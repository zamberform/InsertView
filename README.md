InsertView
==========

Insert some Views on cocos2d-x by Jni

3 hours want to do something release.
and As Result
Made a sample demo what is about Jni on Android By cocos2d-x3.0 With the NativeActivity.

I hava made Dailog Webview Activity and CustomFragment which you can directlly call on C++ by Jni.
Demo Looks like 「LoveLive」 Openning.(I like LoveLive~)

Easy to understand, also  
You can make your own test projects,download my file and input to your projects.
I think it will work well.

Take Care Point:
You must clear to know MainUIThread and OpenGLThread.
We must add my own view which should run on MainUIThread.

Have a good luck~~
